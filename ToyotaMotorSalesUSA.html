		<h4 id = "Plano" > Plano headquarters move </h4>
		<p>In 2014 Toyota announced it was moving its United States headquarters to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plano,_Texas"> Plano, Texas </a> in the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth"> Dallas-Fort Worth </a> area.[4] The new headquarters will have around 4,000 total employees, including about 2,000 employees from the current headquarters and 1,000 employees from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Financial_Services"> Toyota Financial Services </a>, which also was in Torrance. The company plans to permanently move most employees by the time of completion of the new headquarters, late 2016 or early 2017, while initially the company will open a temporary office in Texas and move small groups of employees there in the interim.[5] The administration of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Japanese_School"> Dallas Japanese School </a>, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshuko"> supplementary Japanese school </a> serving Japanese citizen and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American"> Japanese American </a> children living in the DFW area, stated that it expected to receive an additional 150 students due to the headquarters move.[6] </p>

		<p>
		The company formerly maintained its headquarters in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance,_California"> Torrance, California </a> in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles_Area"> Greater Los Angeles </a>. The campus has six buildings,[9] with a total of 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of office space.[4] In 2012 a 1.1 megawatt hydrogen fuel cell generator was installed at the campus, giving half of the power for the six buildings during the peak demand period. The generator does not generate emissions. By using the generator, as of 2012 the company saves $130,000 in utility bill charges.[9] As of 2014 the headquarters has 5,300 employees.[4]	
		</p>

		<p>
			On October 31, 1957,[10] Toyota opened its first United States office in a former <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_(automobile)"> Rambler </a> / <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company"> Ford dealership</a>, at 6000 <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Blvd"> Hollywood Blvd </a>. As of July 2022 that building is still a Toyota dealership. Because the city had airline access to Tokyo and because of the proximity to the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Los_Angeles"> Port of Los Angeles </a> the US division of Toyota located its headquarters in the Los Angeles area.[4] 
		</p>

		<p> The Torrance headquarters opened in 1982.[4] In 2003 the Toyota South Campus in Torrance received the Golden Nugget Award.[11] </p>

 		<h2 id = "Distribution">Distribution </h2>
 		<p>In early 1968, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Moran_(businessman)"> Jim Moran </a> was contacted by a friend from Chicago who said that <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Motor_Manufacturing_North_America"> Toyota </a> wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and wanted to talk to him. Moran asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market at the end of the 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business.[12] On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Jacksonville"> Port of Jacksonville </a> and Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year.[13] </p>

 		
 		<p> There was a similar story for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Friedkin"> Thomas H. Friedkin </a>. During the 1960s, one of Friedkin's hobbies was racing cars. He was friends with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Shelby"> Carroll Shelby </a>, famous for designing the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Cobra"> AC Cobra </a> and the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Mustang"> Shelby Mustang </a>. Shelby had turned down an offer to become a distributor for Toyota because <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Iacocca"> Lee Iacocca </a> told Shelby that "the domestic makers were going to push the Japanese back into the ocean".[14][15] Shelby introduced Friedkin to Toyota, and Friedkin entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Houston"> Port of Houston </a>. Gulf States Toyota Distributors (GST) was founded in 1969.[16][14] </p>

 		<p> Toyota Dealers in the remaining 40 states receive their vehicles from Toyota Motor Sales. </p>
